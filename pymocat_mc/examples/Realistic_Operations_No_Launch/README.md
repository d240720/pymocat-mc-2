# Realistic Operations No Launch Examples - Python

This directory contains Python implementation of realistic space operations scenario without future launches.

## Files

- **`realistic_operations_no_launch.py`** - Main realistic operations scenario script
- **`python_realistic_ops_no_launch_figure_*.png`** - Generated visualization plots

## Description

This scenario simulates realistic modern space operations parameters with:
- No future launches (decay-only scenario from 2020 initial conditions)
- Realistic 85% post-mission disposal compliance (vs 95% ideal)
- 6-unit typical satellite mission lifetime (vs 8-unit default)
- 2% collision avoidance failure probability (realistic operations)
- Limited explosion probability (5e-7)
- High-resolution simulation with 5-day timesteps

Note: While `launchRepeatYrs = [2018, 2022]` is defined in the configuration, it is NOT used since the scenario runs with `launch_model = 'no_launch'`.

## Usage

```bash
cd Realistic_Operations_No_Launch/
python realistic_operations_no_launch.py
```

## Outputs

The script generates comprehensive visualization plots showing:
1. Population summary over time
2. Orbital element distributions
3. 3D position visualization
4. Altitude vs eccentricity relationships
5. Summary statistics

Results are saved as PNG figures for analysis and reporting.

## Equivalent MATLAB Files

This Python script is equivalent to `realistic_operations_no_launch.m` in the MATLAB implementation.
